This is the repo representing my progress in machine learnining. 

Flow: 

üß© PHASE A: Foundations & Core Concepts

Step	Topic	Goal
A1	Python + Libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)	Data manipulation and analysis
A2	Math & Stats (Linear Algebra, Probability, Stats)	Build intuition behind algorithms
A3	Supervised Learning (Regression + Classification)	Understand how labeled data is used
A4	Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)	Learn from unlabeled data

‚öôÔ∏è PHASE B: Model Optimization & Evaluation

Step	Topic	Why It Matters
B1	Feature Engineering	Make models smarter with better input
B2	Data Imbalance Handling	Crucial for real-world problems (e.g., fraud)
B3	Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)	Boost performance
B4	Cross-Validation (K-Fold, Stratified)	Robust evaluation
B5	Advanced Metrics (ROC-AUC, Log Loss, Silhouette)	Deeper insights than accuracy

üí° Goal: Improve existing models using these.

üß† PHASE C: Deep Learning
The jump from traditional ML to Neural Networks.

Step	Topic	Framework
C1	Neural Networks (Perceptron, Backpropagation)	Basics of deep learning
C2	Feedforward + CNN + RNN architectures	Image, sequence, and time series handling
C3	Use PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras	Build and train your own models

üöÄ PHASE D: Specializations (Pick Based on Interest)
Focus on areas that excite you.

Track	What You Learn
NLP	Transformers, BERT, Chatbots, Language Models
Computer Vision	CNNs, Image Detection, Segmentation
Time Series	Forecasting, LSTMs, ARIMA
Reinforcement Learning	Q-Learning, Policy Gradients
